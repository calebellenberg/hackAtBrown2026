# Extension TypeScript Build Guide

The extension has been converted to TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

## Files

- `content.ts` - Content script that extracts prices from web pages
- `popup.ts` - Popup script that handles the UI and messaging
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for the extension
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by `tsc`)

## Building

From the project root, run:

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

Or to watch for changes and auto-recompile:

```bash
npm run watch:extension
```

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `extension/` folder
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## After Modifying TypeScript Files

1. Run `npm run build:extension` to compile the `.ts` files to `dist/`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click the refresh icon on your extension
3. The extension will now use the updated compiled code

## Types

The extension uses `@types/chrome` for proper TypeScript support of the Chrome Extension API.
